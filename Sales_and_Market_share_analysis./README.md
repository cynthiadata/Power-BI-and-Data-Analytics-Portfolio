The dataset provided focuses on sales and market share analysis.  This type of analysis is very common for the office of a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO).

Our company, VanArsdel, manufactures expensive electronic products that could be used for fun as well as work and it sells them directly to consumers in three major markets.

Sales data along with details of Product, Date and Geography are available in an Excel workbook. Data from these sources need to be brought together to analyze and report on.
